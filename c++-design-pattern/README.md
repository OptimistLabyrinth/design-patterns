# Handling CMake Project

#### 1. create directory with a name such as 'output', 'dist'

```shell
mkdir output
```

#### 2. move into the newly created directory

```shell
cd output
```

#### 3. build inside the directory using CMakeLists.txt file in project root

```shell
cmake ..
make
```

#### 4. run executable

```shell
./cppDesignPattern
```
